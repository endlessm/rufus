# If you're having trouble building this project due to this script, read on!

# By default, you can't actually execute PowerShell scripts without running
# `Set-ExecutionPolicy FOO`, where FOO is "Unrestricted" to allow running
# any script, or RemoteSigned/AllSigned if we wanted to commit a signed
# version of the script to our repo.

# You only have to run this once per machine. If this proves to be a problem
# in practice, we can rewrite this in BAT or otherwise rethink it.

# Fail if any command fails. Equivalent to `set -e` in Bash.
