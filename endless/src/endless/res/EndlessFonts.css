/* 
Theoretically eot files will work for all versions of IE from 6 to latest (Edge at this point).
If it doesn't make the binary too big it doesn't hurt to add the TTF files also in case MS decides to drop EOT support.
We can of course take into consideration including woff files also.

Unfortunately we need to define different names for the fonts based on font-weight because previous to IE9 IE doesn't know
how to select the proper font based on element font-weight.
